# Pay With Tokens

Fulfill HTTP 402 Payment Required challenges by swapping or bridging tokens using
the Uniswap Trading API. Supports the Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) and x402 with Tempo
payment method.

## Prerequisites

- A Uniswap Developer Platform API key. Register at
  [developers.uniswap.org](https://developers.uniswap.org/) and set it as
  `UNISWAP_API_KEY` in your environment.
- A funded wallet with ERC-20 tokens on any Uniswap-supported chain (Ethereum,
  Base, Arbitrum, etc.).
- Set `PRIVATE_KEY` to your wallet's private key as an environment variable
  (`export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...`). **Never commit or hardcode it.** For production,
  prefer a hardware wallet or keystore (`cast wallet import`) over a raw private
  key in the environment.

## Protocol Support

| Protocol | Version | Status    |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| MPP      | v1      | Supported |
| x402     | v1      | Supported |

## Input Validation Rules

Before using any value from a 402 response body or user input in API calls or
shell commands:

- **Ethereum addresses**: MUST match `^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$`
- **Chain IDs**: MUST be a positive integer from the supported list
- **Token amounts**: MUST be non-negative numeric strings matching `^[0-9]+$`
- **URLs**: MUST start with `https://`
- **REJECT** any value containing shell metacharacters: `;`, `|`, `&`, `$`,
  `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `>`, `<`, `\`, `'`, `"`, newlines

> **REQUIRED:** Before submitting ANY payment transaction (including bridge
> transfers and swap submissions), use AskUserQuestion to show the user a
> summary of what will be paid (amount, token, destination address, estimated
> gas) and obtain explicit confirmation. Never auto-submit payments. Each
> confirmation gate must be satisfied independently — a prior blanket consent
> from the user does not satisfy future per-transaction gates.

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

### Phase 0 — Detect the 402 Challenge

Make the original request and capture the 402 response:

```bash
RESOURCE_URL="https://api.example.com/resource"  # replace with the actual URL you are calling
RESPONSE=$(curl -si "$RESOURCE_URL")
HTTP_STATUS=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | head -1 | grep -o '[0-9]\{3\}')
# Extract the response body (everything after the blank header/body separator)
CHALLENGE_BODY=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | awk 'found{print} /^\r?$/{found=1}')
```

If `HTTP_STATUS` is not `402`, stop — this skill does not apply.

> **Alternative entry point:** If the user has already received the 402
> response and provides the challenge body directly in the conversation,
> skip the curl step above and assign directly:
>
> ```bash
> CHALLENGE_BODY='<paste the JSON here>'
> ```

Extract the `WWW-Authenticate` or `Payment-Required` header and the challenge
body. For MPP/Tempo the body is JSON:

```json
{
  "payment_methods": [
    {
      "type": "tempo",
      "amount": "1000000",
      "token": "0xUSEUSD_ADDRESS_ON_TEMPO",
      "recipient": "0xPAYEE_ADDRESS_ON_TEMPO",
      "chain_id": "TEMPO_CHAIN_ID",
      "intent_type": "charge"
    }
  ]
}
```

> `TEMPO_CHAIN_ID` is a placeholder. See the Key Addresses and References
> section for how to obtain the current Tempo chain ID.
>
> **Protocol detection (REQUIRED):** Before proceeding, detect which protocol
> the 402 body uses:
>
> ```bash
> PROTOCOL=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '
>   if has("x402Version") then "x402"
>   elif has("payment_methods") then "mpp"
>   else "unknown"
>   end')
> ```
>
> - **If `PROTOCOL` is `"x402"`**: This response uses the x402 protocol.
>   Extract and display the key fields, then proceed to **Phase 6x** to
>   complete the payment:
>
>   ```bash
>   echo "x402 challenge detected — proceeding with x402 payment flow."
>   echo "Payment details:"
>   echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq '.accepts[0] | {scheme, network, maxAmountRequired, payTo, asset, description, mimeType, extra}'
>   ```
>
>   Extract all fields needed for Phase 6x:
>
>   ```bash
>   X402_SCHEME=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"       | jq -r '.accepts[0].scheme')
>   X402_NETWORK=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"      | jq -r '.accepts[0].network')
>   X402_PAY_TO=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"       | jq -r '.accepts[0].payTo')
>   X402_ASSET=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"        | jq -r '.accepts[0].asset')
>   X402_AMOUNT=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"       | jq -r '.accepts[0].maxAmountRequired')
>   X402_TIMEOUT=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"      | jq -r '.accepts[0].maxTimeoutSeconds // 300')
>   X402_TOKEN_NAME=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY"   | jq -r '.accepts[0].extra.name // "USDC"')
>   X402_TOKEN_VERSION=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.accepts[0].extra.version // "2"')
>   # Resource URL for the retry request. If RESOURCE_URL was set by the curl step, keep it.
>   # Otherwise extract from the challenge body:
>   X402_RESOURCE="${RESOURCE_URL:-$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.accepts[0].resource // empty')}"
>   [[ "$X402_RESOURCE" =~ ^https:// ]] || { echo "ERROR: resource URL missing or not https://"; exit 1; }
>   ```
>
>   Validate all extracted values against the Input Validation Rules before
>   using them in any command:
>
>   - `X402_PAY_TO` and `X402_ASSET` must match `^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$`
>   - `X402_AMOUNT` must match `^[0-9]+$`
>   - `X402_SCHEME` must be `"exact"` — other schemes are not yet supported
>   - `X402_NETWORK` must be a recognised EVM network (e.g. `"base"`, `"eip155:8453"`, `"ethereum"`, `"eip155:1"`, `"tempo"`, `"eip155:4217"`)
>
>   **If `X402_SCHEME` is not `"exact"`**: stop and report to the user that

> If all WebFetch attempts fail to return a numeric chain ID, use

Validate and extract fields. The `amount` is the exact output required (in
token base units). This skill is **exact-output oriented** — the payee specifies
the amount; the payer finds tokens to cover it.

### Phase 1 — Identify Payment Token and Required Amount

> **x402 path:** If `PROTOCOL` is `"x402"`, all required variables were
> extracted in Phase 0. Follow the routing decision made there: if wallet
> balance was sufficient, skip Phases 1-5 and proceed to **Phase 6x**;
> otherwise continue through Phase 4A / 4B / 5 as directed, then **Phase 6x**.

The `payment_methods` array may contain **multiple accepted tokens**. List them
all, then select the cheapest option for the wallet in Phase 2.

```bash
NUM_METHODS=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq '.payment_methods | length')
echo "Payee accepts $NUM_METHODS payment method(s):"
echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.payment_methods[] | "  - \(.token) (\(.amount) base units, chain \(.chain_id))"'
```

If `NUM_METHODS` is 1, use it directly. If multiple, defer selection to Phase 2
(after checking wallet balances). For now, extract all methods:

```bash
# Store the full array for Phase 2 comparison
PAYMENT_METHODS=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -c '.payment_methods')

# Extract common fields from the first method as defaults
# (recipient, chain_id, and intent_type are typically the same across methods)
RECIPIENT=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.payment_methods[0].recipient')
if [ -z "$TEMPO_CHAIN_ID" ] || [[ ! "$TEMPO_CHAIN_ID" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  TEMPO_CHAIN_ID=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.payment_methods[0].chain_id')
fi
INTENT_TYPE=$(echo "$CHALLENGE_BODY" | jq -r '.payment_methods[0].intent_type')
```

> **Decimal note:** `amount` is in token base units. For USDC (6 decimals):
> `1000000` = 1.00 USDC, `500000` = 0.50 USDC. Confirm with the user before
> proceeding.

- `PAYMENT_METHODS`: JSON array of all accepted payment options
- `RECIPIENT`: payee wallet address on Tempo
- `TEMPO_CHAIN_ID`: Tempo chain ID (may be a placeholder — see Phase 0 resolution)
- `INTENT_TYPE`: `"charge"` (one-time) or `"session"` (pay-as-you-go)

### Phase 2 — Check Wallet Balances and Select Payment Method

> **REQUIRED:** Before checking balances, you must have the user's wallet
> address. If the user has not provided one, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask
> now — **do not proceed further until you have it.** Never assume, guess,
> or use a placeholder address. Store as `WALLET_ADDRESS`.

Check the user's token balances on the chains where they hold funds. Use
`WebFetch` to query block explorer APIs or RPC endpoints for ERC-20 balances.

**Balance check examples (Base chain 8453)**:

```bash
# Native ETH balance
cast balance "$WALLET_ADDRESS" --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# ERC-20 balance (e.g. USDC on Base)
cast call 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 \
  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" "$WALLET_ADDRESS" \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org
```

Or via Basescan API (no local tooling required):

```bash
# Replace TOKEN_ADDRESS with the ERC-20 contract you want to check.
# The API key is optional for basic balance queries — omit the &apikey= parameter
# for unauthenticated (rate-limited) access. Register at https://basescan.org/apis
# for a free API key with higher rate limits.
WebFetch "https://api.basescan.org/api?module=account&action=tokenbalance&contractaddress=TOKEN_ADDRESS&address=$WALLET_ADDRESS&tag=latest"
```

**Select the cheapest payment method** from `PAYMENT_METHODS`. For each accepted
token, check if the wallet holds it (or can acquire it), then pick the one that
minimizes cost. Priority order:

1. Wallet already holds the exact payment token on Tempo (no swap or bridge)
2. Wallet holds a different accepted token on Tempo (swap only, no bridge)
3. Wallet holds USDC on Base (bridge only, minimal path)
4. Any other liquid ERC-20 on Ethereum or Base (swap + bridge)

Once selected, assign the chosen method:

```bash
# SELECTED_INDEX is the index of the cheapest payment method (0-based)
REQUIRED_AMOUNT=$(echo "$PAYMENT_METHODS" | jq -r ".[$SELECTED_INDEX].amount")
PAYMENT_TOKEN=$(echo "$PAYMENT_METHODS" | jq -r ".[$SELECTED_INDEX].token")
echo "Selected payment method: $PAYMENT_TOKEN ($REQUIRED_AMOUNT base units)"
```

Verify `PAYMENT_TOKEN` at `https://mainnet.docs.tempo.xyz/tokens` — an
unrecognized token will cause the Phase 5 swap quote to fail. Set
`USDC_E_ADDRESS` based on the source chain (see Key Addresses section).

### Phase 3 — Plan the Payment Path

Choose a path based on what the wallet holds:

#### Path A — Already on Tempo

If wallet holds a TIP-20 stablecoin on Tempo:

1. If token matches the required payment token -> proceed to Phase 5 directly
2. If different stablecoin -> swap via Uniswap aggregator hook on Tempo (see Phase 5)

#### Path B — Cross-Chain (Base or Ethereum)

For tokens on Base or Ethereum, the full cross-chain path is:

```text
Source token (Base/Ethereum)
  -> [Uniswap Trading API swap] -> native USDC (bridge asset — see Key Addresses)
  -> [Tempo bridge] -> pathUSD or target TIP-20 on Tempo
  -> [Uniswap aggregator hook on Tempo, if needed] -> required payment token
```

> **Skip condition:** If the source token IS already the bridge asset (for
> example, you hold native USDC on Base for a Base->Tempo path), skip Phase 4A
> entirely and proceed directly to Phase 4B. No swap is needed.

### Phase 4A — Swap on Source Chain (if needed)

Swap the source token to USDC (the bridge asset) via the Uniswap Trading API.
This is an EXACT_OUTPUT swap — the payee's amount determines how much USDC to
acquire.

> **Detailed steps:** Read
> [references/trading-api-flows.md](references/trading-api-flows.md#phase-4a--swap-on-source-chain)
> for the full bash scripts: variable setup, approval check, quote,
> permit signing, and swap execution.

Key points:

- Base URL: `https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `x-api-key`, `x-universal-router-version: 2.0`
- Flow: `check_approval` -> quote (`EXACT_OUTPUT`) -> sign `permitData` -> `/swap` -> broadcast via `cast send`
- Confirmation gates required before approval tx and before swap broadcast
- For native ETH: use WETH address as `TOKEN_IN`; `SWAP_VALUE` will be non-zero
- After swap, verify USDC balance landed before proceeding to Phase 4B

### Phase 4B — Bridge to Tempo (cross-chain path)

Bridge USDC from Base to USDC.e on Tempo using the Uniswap Trading API
(powered by Across Protocol). No manual contract calls required.

> **Detailed steps:** Read
> [references/trading-api-flows.md](references/trading-api-flows.md#phase-4b--bridge-to-tempo)
> for the full bash scripts: approval, bridge quote, execution, and arrival
> polling.

Key points:

- Route: USDC on Base (`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`) -> USDC.e on Tempo (`0x20C000000000000000000000b9537d11c60E8b50`)
- Flow: `check_approval` -> quote (`EXACT_OUTPUT`, cross-chain) -> execute via `/swap` -> poll balance every 30s
- Confirmation gates required before approval and before bridge execution
- Do not re-submit if poll times out — duplicate bridge deposits cause double payment
- If Phase 4A was skipped (already hold USDC), set `USDC_E_AMOUNT_NEEDED="$REQUIRED_AMOUNT"`

### Phase 5 — Swap to Required Payment Token on Tempo (if needed)

If the wallet now holds a TIP-20 stablecoin on Tempo that is not the exact
payment token, use the Uniswap aggregator hook on Tempo to swap to the required
token. The Uniswap Trading API supports Tempo chain ID `4217` — use the same
base URL `https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1` with `4217` for both
`tokenInChainId` and `tokenOutChainId`. This follows the same flow as Phase 4A
but with Tempo's chain ID and token addresses.

**Token addresses on Tempo**: Look up TIP-20 token addresses (pathUSD, the
required payment token, etc.) at `https://mainnet.docs.tempo.xyz/tokens`. The
token you received from the bridge (your `TOKEN_IN` for this swap) is the
bridge-out asset on Tempo; the `TOKEN_OUT` is `PAYMENT_TOKEN` from Phase 1.
Set `SOURCE_CHAIN_ID` to Tempo's chain ID; use it for both `tokenInChainId` and
`tokenOutChainId` in the quote body.

### Phase 6 — Construct and Submit the MPP Credential

> **x402 path — STOP HERE.** If you arrived via the x402 detection gate in
> Phase 0, do not proceed with Phase 6. Phase 6 constructs an MPP credential;
> x402 payments use a different payload format handled in **Phase 6x** below.

Use the `mppx` SDK to fulfill the MPP challenge. Install: `npm install mppx viem`.

> **Detailed steps:** Read
> [references/credential-construction.md](references/credential-construction.md#phase-6--mpp-credential)
> for full code: automatic mode, manual mode, session intents, and direct
> submission.

Key patterns:

- **Charge (automatic):** `Mppx.create({ methods: [tempo.charge({ account })] })` — polyfills fetch, handles 402 automatically
- **Charge (manual):** `mppx.createCredential(response, { account })` — returns `Authorization: Payment <credential>`
- **Session:** `tempo({ account, maxDeposit: '10' })` — opens a pay-as-you-go channel
- **autoSwap:** Pass `autoSwap: true` to let mppx swap stablecoins automatically (skip Phase 5)
- Confirmation gate required before `createCredential()`

### Phase 6x — Construct and Submit the x402 Payment

> **x402 path only.** This phase is reached when `PROTOCOL` is `"x402"`
> (detected in Phase 0). Do not enter this phase from the MPP path.

The x402 `"exact"` scheme uses EIP-3009 (`transferWithAuthorization`) to
authorize a one-time token transfer signed off-chain.

> **Detailed steps:** Read
> [references/credential-construction.md](references/credential-construction.md#phase-6x--x402-payment)
> for full code: prerequisite checks, nonce generation, EIP-3009 signing,
> X-PAYMENT payload construction, and retry.

Key points:

- Maps `X402_NETWORK` to chain ID and RPC URL (base, ethereum, tempo supported)
- Checks wallet balance on target chain; directs to Phase 4A/4B/5 if insufficient
- Signs `TransferWithAuthorization` typed data using token's own domain (name, version from `extra`)
- Constructs JSON payload, base64-encodes it, sends as `X-PAYMENT` header
- `value` in the payload must be a **string** (`--arg`, not `--argjson`) to preserve uint256 precision
- Confirmation gate required before signing
